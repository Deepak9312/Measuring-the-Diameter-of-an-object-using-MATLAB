# Measuring-the-Diameter-of-an-object-using-MATLAB
This project is an overview of how we can make use of MATLAB and Image Processing Toolbox to measure the diameter of an object within an image. Measuring objects within an image can be important capability for many applications where computer vision is required instead of making physical requirements. This project will cover a basic step by step code for isolating a desired object and measuring its diameter. Using this code on MATLAB user would be able to process and analyze image and measure the diameter of any object within the image in pixels, centimeter or inches without any advance knowledge of complex coding language.
